# List hubs & projects (Data Management)

The [Data Management API](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/overview/) provides a unified and consistent way to access data across **Hubs** for BIM 360 Team, Fusion Team (formerly known as A360 Team), BIM 360 Docs and A360 Personal.

To navigate and access BIM 360 Team, Fusion Team, BIM 360 Docs, A360 Personal, and OSS data, you need to be familiar with the following terminology:

- `hubs`: a BIM 360 Team hub, Fusion Team hub, BIM 360 Docs account, or A360 Personal hub
- `projects`: a BIM 360 Team, Fusion Team, BIM 360 Docs, or A360 Personal project
- `folders`: a logical organization of items within a project
- `items`: one or more versions of files, such as dwg, pdf, or Fusion designs and drawings
- `versions`: a specific state of an item; analogous to a specific version of a file
- `buckets`: containers for objects with globally unique names
- `objects`: binary data identified by a URN or key, stored in a specific bucket

> Each **BIM 360 Docs** account will be one hub that the current user has access to. To identify these hubs, the `attribute.extension.type` should be **hubs:autodesk.bim360:Account**. Or check the `b.` prefix on the **id**.

At this section, let's create an endpoint to returns list of **Hubs**, **Projects**, **Folders**, **Items** (files) and respective **Versions** (which can be viewed on Viewer).
